# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post where I'll share my thoughts about technology, programming, and my journey as a developer.

## About Me

I'm a software developer passionate about building great user experiences and learning new technologies. I love working with:

- React

- Node.js
- And many more!

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface GreetingProps {
  name: string;
}

const Greeting: React.FC<GreetingProps> = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
```
