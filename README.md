## Backup & Rollback Strategy

This project has a comprehensive backup and rollback strategy:

1. **Git tags** mark stable versions
2. **Content separation** keeps content isolated from UI changes
3. **Feature flags** allow toggling features without code changes
4. **GitHub Actions** automate deployment
5. **Pre-deployment checks** validate builds before deployment

For detailed rollback instructions, see [ROLLBACK.md](./ROLLBACK.md).
